# Elevator Pitch
Looking around yourself with an abundance of free time, such as during the current COVID-19 pandemic, without being able to go out? Wondering where you can spend time with your family, clear your head, or relieve yourself of stress without being able to decide? 

We recognized this issue and designed a park searching website that will remediate your stay at home woes. Our site shows you the weather, a map, and a description of a wide list of parks so you can plan the perfect day to get outside. Our Park Planner site is up and ready to be visited today!

# Project Description
Park Planner is an interactive website which allows Users to conveniently find parks in the State of Georgia. It offers descriptive information about the national parks, captivating pictures - displaying the beauty each park possess, their location, a five-day weather forecast - if favorable or worse, including the humidity. The session will be stored in a database. This will allow the user to actively track the weather anytime using the weather map. In addition to this, the user will have the ability to use their map for directions to their intended park.

# Motivation
Thinking about all the families locked in during this quarantine period of COVID-19, people are suffering from depression, anxiety and indoor sickness. it inspired our team to create Park Planner that provides several users access to the National Parks without any hassle. Creating Park Planner, allows several residents to look forward to spending time outdoors, alleviate their moods, to be able to receive sunlight.

# User Story 
As a quarantined resident of Georgia, I want help deciding where to go when I get out of the house, so I can get some fresh air, sunshine, and to feel free again. Also, it would be great to have a pleasant experience of nature.

# Challenges
Working together as a team was a ton of fun, but this project introduced us to the joys of forced git merges, when (not) to use branches, and passive-aggressive stylistic revisions. We faced several difficult situations as a team during the project: fixing the carousel; ensuring the APIs are loading up the pictures of each park; map did not display; ensuring the site was responsive with a polished user interface.

# Successes
The carousel worked; we were able to ensure the site was responsive across all devices; finally got the map API loading pictures to the site; accumulated knowledge in the process. With a lot of hard work and perseverance, we, as a team, can say, “We did it!”

# Demo
Will be done live.

# Directions for Future Development
We, as a team, hope to improve the site by adding more parks/locations. Add ticket purchasing option; present transportation options, such as Uber and Lyft. Possible layout changes, but for the most part, we believe that the end user will appreciate the uncluttered design.
